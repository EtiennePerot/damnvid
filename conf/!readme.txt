This is DamnVid's configuration directory, home of DamnVid's configuration file, conf.ini. You should normally never have to touch this, as you can edit the preferences easily with DamnVid's preferences dialog (DamnVid -> Preferences). But if something wrong happens for some reason, you can restore DamnVid's default configuration by deleting conf.ini and renaming default.ini to conf.ini. Then, just in case, make a backup of conf.ini (formerly default.ini), so that you can restore it again.
